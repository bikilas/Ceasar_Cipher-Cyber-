# Caesar Cipher
This project is a basic implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption technique. A Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in a text by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This type of cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter is replaced by the letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
